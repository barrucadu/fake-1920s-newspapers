SYDNEY, April 18 (A.~P.)---The Morrison Co.'s freighter
\emph{Vigilant}, bound from Valparaiso, arrived this morning at its
wharf in Darling Harbour, having in tow the battled and disabled but
heavily armed steam yacht \emph{Alert} of Dunedin, N.~Z., which was
sighted April 12th.

The \emph{Vigilant} left Valparaiso March 25th, and on April 2d was
driven considerably south of her course by exceptionally heavy storms
and monster waves.  On April 12th the derelict was sighted; and though
apparently deserted, was found upon boarding to contain one survivor
in a half-delirious condition and one man who had evidently been dead
for more than a week.

The living man was clutching a horrible stone idol of unknown origin,
about a foot in height, regarding whose nature authorities at Sydney
University, the Royal Society, and the Museum in College Street all
profess complete bafflement, and which the survivor says he found in
the cabin of the yacht, in a small carved shrine of common pattern.

This man, after he had recovered his senses, told an exceedingly
strange story of piracy and slaughter.  He is Gustaf Johansen, a
Norwegian of some intelligence, and had been second mate of the
two-masted schooner \emph{Emma} of Auckland, which sailed for Callao
February 20th, with a complement of eleven men.

The \emph{Emma}, he says, was delayed and thrown widely south of her
course by the great storm of March 1st, and on March 22d encountered
the \emph{Alert}, manned by a queer and evil-looking crew of Kanakas
and half-castes.  Being ordered peremptorily to turn back,
Capt. Collins refused; whereupon the strange crew began to fire
savagely and without warning upon the schooner with a peculiarly
heavy battery of brass cannon forming part of the yacht's equipment.

Cable advices from Dunedin report that the \emph{Alert} was well known
there as an island trader, and bore an evil reputation along the
waterfront.  It was owned by a curious group who attracted no little
attention; and it had set sail in great haste just after the storm and
earth tremors of March 1st.

\headlineMainInner{Admiralty to investigate}

The admiralty will institute an inquiry on the whole matter beginning
tomorrow, at which every effort will be made to induce Johansen to
speak more freely than he has done hitherto.
