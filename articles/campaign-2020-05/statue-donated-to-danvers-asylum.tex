\headline{Statue Donated to Danvers Asylum}

The Danvers State Asylum has received an anonymous donation of a
statue of Dr.~Shine, who made the facility into a model center for
care.  Dr.~Berger, the current superintendent, is pleased with the
gift, but confesses to some perplexity over the identity of the donor.

Dr.~Shine was superintendent of Danvers State Asylum from 1890 to
1915.  Prior to his arrival, the asylum had suffered from a poor
reputation and staff morale was low.  Patient accident and mortality
rates were among the highest in the country.
