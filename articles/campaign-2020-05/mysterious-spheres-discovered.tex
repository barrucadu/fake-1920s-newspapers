\headline{Mysterious Spheres Discovered}

An expedition lead by Prof. Rodr√≠guez of the Jade Museum returned last
week with a dozen large stone spheres, discovered by workers on a
banana plantation.  Some of the spheres are plain, others are
decorated with carvings depicting Tarathew, the Bribri god of Thunder.
The professor plans to send a larger expedition to recover more of the
spheres, which number in the hundreds.

``The spheres are remarkably precise,'' a spokesman for the museum
said, ``it is hard to imagine how the ancients could have carved such
huge stones so accurately.''

In addition to recovering more of the spheres, the museum plans to
break open some of the ones they retrieved, to see if any treasures
are concealed inside.
