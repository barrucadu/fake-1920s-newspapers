NAIROBI (Reuters)---Five Nandi tribesmen, convicted ringleaders of
the vicious Carlyle Expedition massacre, were executed this morning
after a short, expertly-conducted trial.

To the end, the tribesmen steadfastly refused to reveal why they had
slaughtered Mr. Carlyle and his companions.  Mr. Harvis, acting for
the Colony, cleverly implied throughout the trial that the massacre
was racial in motivation, and that the fair-skinned victims were
subject to the most savage treatment, preventing all but the most
preliminary identification of the remains.

Miss Erica Carlyle, defeated in her efforts to rescue her brother,
left several weeks ago, but is surely comforted now the triumph of
justice.
