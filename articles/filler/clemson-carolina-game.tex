\headline{Clemson-Carolina Game}

Dick Swetenburg pitched for Clemson in the game yesterday at Clemson
College between Clemson and Carolina.  It was a fine game, Swetenburg
allowed only six scattered hits and his team makes gave him air-tight
support.  Reames stole three bases.  The score was three to one in
favor of Clemson.  The following attended from Abbeville: Carroll
Swetenburg, Russell Thomson, Goode Thomson, Jordan Ramey, Bayard
Swetenburg, Neill Swetenburg, and Prue Bell.
