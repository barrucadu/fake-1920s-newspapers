\headline{Successful Entertainment at Vaughnville~School}

One of the enjoyable social features of the Vaghnville community was
the entertainment given by the school at the new building.  There was
not a single hitch in the execution of the program from the beginning
to the finis.  Each child did his part remarkably well, especially
those beginners, who successfully dramatized the nursery rhyme of
Lucky Locket.  The play, ``Mother Goose Up to Date,'' was a great
success.
