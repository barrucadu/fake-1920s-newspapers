\headline{Tinoco Statues Destroyed}

Monuments erected during the regime of Federico Tinoco were found torn
from their plinths and disfigured this morning.  ``These statues,
although symbolic, cast a shadow on the dreams of the people,'' said
President Acosta, and suggested that they could be replaced by
monuments celebrating the restoration of democracy by President
Segura.

Suitable replacements will be debated in the council meeting on
Thursday.
