\headline{Flashes Badge at Hotel, Pays \$5 Fine}

Flashing a badge that looked like that worn by policemen, Roman
Struck, 39 years old, 530 Powder Mill st., threatened the owners of a
hotel at Gedney and Armitage st.\ with arrest.  The sight of two
policemen, who were called, induced Struck to step into his more
accustomed role of a civilian.  When questioned by police as to why he
made the impersonation, he replied, ``I thought it would be fun.''

In district court today he was fined \$5 on charge of being drunk.
