\headline{Alexandria Veterans Form New Post}

Another post was added to the growing number of the Veterans of
Foreign Wars Thursday night when thirty veterans of Alexandria, Va.,
organized the Russell Mitchell Post named in honor of one of the first
Alexandria Yanks to die in the world war.

Thirty applications for membership were received.  H.~L.~Arnold was
elected commander; J.~P.~Balinger, adjutant, and James E.~Nagel,
treasurer.  The post was installed by the District of Columbia
department officers.
