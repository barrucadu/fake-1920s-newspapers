SAO PAULO (Reuters)---A telegram received at Sao Paulo late today
advised the Italian Consul that Mauranta Quarenta, mechanic of Count
di Robilant's plane, died at San Jos√© this morning from injuries and
exhaustion.  Count di Robilant, occupying the next bed, when in formed
of Signor Quarenta's death shortly before noon, at first refused to
believe it.  Later he developed a high fever, causing considerable
alarm.  The hospital doctors now fear di Robilant may be suffering
from a tropical fever contracted during his eighteen days of
wandering, after the crash of his plane.

The Italian Consul at Sao Paulo informed Signor Quarenta's family,
living at Rio de Janeiro, of his death and the Italian Government will
transport the family to Italy.

Count di Robilant is unable to see visitors and the hospital doctors
here advised the Vice Consul at Sao Paulo that he will be transported
tomorrow morning to Assis, where better medical assistance is
obtainable.  He is believed to be out of danger, but requires special
treatment.

Signor Quarenta died as the result of yellow fever contracted on the
tortuous walk through dense forests, it is reported.  Count di
Robilant, although also affected, is expected to regain his health
soon.
