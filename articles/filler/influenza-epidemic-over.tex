\headline{Influenza Epidemic Over?}

The foreign influenza strain, which arrived in Limón in February and
has caused the death of 2,300 of our countrymen, has seen no new
fatalities in three months.  Dr. Antonio Facio, in charge of the Limón
Hospital (owned by the United Fruit Company), says he is
``optimistic'' and that ``we may have reached the end.''

This humble journalist would like to thank God Almighty for His great
mercy in freeing us from this menace, and encourages all the faithful
to attend Mass and sing His praises once the mask order is rescinded.
