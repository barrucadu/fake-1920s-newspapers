Fake 1920s Newspapers
=====================

This repo contains a class for creating something which looks kind of
like a 1920s newspaper, with two example layouts.  The class assumes
you have the [HPLHS fonts][] stored in `~/s/fonts/hplhs`.

The `articles/` directory contains articles I've written to use as
props in my games.  If you're in a Call of Cthulhu game I'm currently
running, don't look there!
